    <p>I am a 300 level student of Systems Engineering, University of Lagos</p>
    <p>I am the second son of a family of two sons</p>
    <p>I have a deep passion to learn at least one programming language in the year 2020</p>
    <p>I am a brown skin fellow. 5"8" tall. Yeah, I know I'm not as tall as I would like to be</p>
    <p>I am a very goal driven person, once I put my mind to something, you can hardly stop me</p>
    <p>But I was trained to used that drive and energy positively</p>
    <p>I annoy my family and friends a lot, they say I am too nice, lol.</p>
    <p>I believe I can make a huge difference in my world</p>
    <p> I am a people's person, as much as I tend to get all the love, you can hardly not love me, lol</p>
    <p>I am a very quiet person, an introvert you might call me</p>
    <p>I very much hate crowded places, very much</p>
    <p>And so, that's that about me that for now.</p>
